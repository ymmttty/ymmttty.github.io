#Privacy policy

We do not provide personally identifiable information to third parties. We pay close attention to the management of personal information.

To improve the convenience of the application, we anonymously obtain non-personally identifiable information and analyze access.

For example, when an app crashes, we anonymously send the location of the crash so that we can fix the bug quickly.

We also analyze the usage rate of device and app versions, the usage rate of specific functions, etc. to help improve the app.
